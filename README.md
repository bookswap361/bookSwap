# bookSwap
Book Swap Application for CS 361

Users can create an account to list books they have and want to swap with others. Swapping utilizes a point based system- they can use points to request a book and gain points for a trade. This is the collaborative work between Emily Addiego, Marissa Castillo, Kyle Esquerra, Jane Fong, and Lindsey Olmstead.
