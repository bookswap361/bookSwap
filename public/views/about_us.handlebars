            <h3>What can I do with my forword account?</h3></div>
            <p>Once you've created an account, you can list books that you own and would like to swap, create a wishlist of books you want to read later, and request, accept, or decline swaps from other users.</p>
        <div class="question"> 
            <h3>How do I add books to my account?</h3></div>
            <p>Starting from your account dashboard, click the "add new book" button to search for books. If the book you're looking for isn't in our database, you will have the option to add it to our library. Once you've found the book you're looking for, you can click on the option to add it to your book list or your wishlist.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>What are my points for?</h3></div>
            <p>Points are forword's "currency." Every time you add a book to your booklist, you receive one point. When you request a swap, you must have enough points to pay for the book.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>What happens to my points after a swap?</h3></div>
            <p>After a swap is accepted, points are transferred from the user who requested the swap to the user who sent the book. So, if you request a swap, the amount of points the book is worth will go to the user who sends you the book. If you send a book to another user, you will receive points from them.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Wait, but how do I swap?</h3></div>
            <p>Your account dashboard will show a list of swaps you've requested and swaps requested from you. If you want to request a new swap, click "add new book" on your account page or go to the search page. If a book is available to swap, you can click on the option to request a swap.<br><br>
            On the other hand, if someone wants to swap from you, you'll get a notification on your account dashboard. You can accept or decline the swap request from there. If you decide to accept the swap, you'll be given the user's shipping details so you know where to send the book.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>What if my requested swap doesn't arrive or is in different condition than was listed on the website?</h3></div>
            <p>
            If your book doesn't arrive, you can report the book as missing and the points you spent will be refunded to you. If a book arrives in poorer condition than was listed, you can file a complaint and someone from the forword team will review your claim and re-distribute points as appropriate.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>What if the book I sent gets lost in the mail?</h3></div>
            <p>Every user gets a loss limit of 1 book, just in case a book gets lost in the mail. However, if your books <i>keep</i> getting lost in the mail we'll get suspcious and start rewarding points back to the user who requested the swap.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>How does the book search work?</h3></div>
            <p>Our book search is wonderfully powered by <a href="https://openlibrary.org/" target="_blank">OpenLibrary</a><br><br>
            Just type in the title (or author) you're looking for and hit 'search' !</p>
